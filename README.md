# Homework-001
My Python homework, maybe it could be better.

	A simple python script that can draw graph of "y = max(abs(x * sin(x)), abs(x * cos(x)))"
and "y = min(abs(x * sin(x)), abs(x * cos(x)))".
	Using "pylab" lib which is a part of "matplotlib" lib. So, if you want to get this library
you should install "matplotlib" though command : "pip install matplotlib".
